# The `sxs` notebooks

This repository collects a few notebooks illustrating how to use the [`sxs` python
package](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/sxs/).  Click the "binder" link above to run them in a
live python session hosted on the web.  Once the binder session opens, you'll probably want to
proceed through the notebook in numerical order.  Note that binder has a 2GB memory limit, so you'll
have to shut down each notebook after you're done with it by going to the "File" menu and clicking
"Close and Halt".

My presentation of this material in a workshop at Brown University's
[ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f20/) can be viewed
[here](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/?play=2351), or you can just view the presentation
slides on binder by clicking on "presentation.ipynb" and pressing the bar chart button.  The full
documentation is found [here](https://sxs.readthedocs.io/en/main/?badge=main).
